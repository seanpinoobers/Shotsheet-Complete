                                                            Notes:

	Collect Date should only be marked in Field Maps for Inspected structures (Not Access Issue).

                        White-out shots are necessary for structure timestamp assignment
		
         Check structure material options as needed (default is Steel for Tower and Wood for Pole)		
	            For permission errors right-click and choose 'Run as Administrator'
