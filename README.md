# Shotsheet-Complete
Automated script for filling PDFs. Hours are spent filling in ID numbers and information for inspected poles so I decided to automate the process!
There are some dependencies to run this script. A KML with structure lat/long data. A PDF template. I don't own either of those so they are not available here. Also in code, I've anonymized the pilot names and user names for Field Maps logins.
There are some libraries that are necessary to run this code. Those can be downloaded in Powershell using the pip installer.
